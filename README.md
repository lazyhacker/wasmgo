This is some experimental code for working with Go and WebAssembly.

build.sh assumes that the 'go' command is located in $HOME/go-wasm/bin. Make sure GOROOT is pointing to the 'go' command that has WASM support.

See https://blog.lazyhacker.com/2018/05/webassembly-wasm-with-go.html for how to build Go with WASM.
